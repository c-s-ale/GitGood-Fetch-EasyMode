# GitGood-Fetch-EasyMode
An easy case for fetching and merging remote changes to your local repository.

For starters, this is the simplest and cleanest case of `git fetch` you'll likely ever see - while it's not practical, it is nice to ease into what `git fetch` is doing, and how we interact with it before we get to some more "interesting" cases!

## Step 1 - Fork this repo!

At this point, you'll hopefully know how to fork, but if not you can check out [this](https://github.com/chris-alexiuk/GitGood-Forking) repo!

## Step 2 - Clone the fork! 

That's right, we'll be [cloning](https://github.com/chris-alexiuk/GitGood-Cloning) our fork to our local!

## Step 3 - Make a remote change!

It can be as simple as editing the README.md, as long as you make - and then commit a change on the remote repository!

## Step 4 - It's time to fetch!

It's as easy as `git fetch` in the command line of your local repository - and away you go!
